(****************************************************************
 * Visitor support code
 *
 * The code in this file is copied from George Necula's excellent
 * CIL project (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/)
 * with minor change to allow it to be used with an arbitrary AST.

(****************************************************************
 * Visit action
 *
 * Visitor methods can request one of four actions on the AST.
 ****************************************************************)

(** Different visiting actions. 'a will be instantiated with [expr], [stmt],
    etc. *)
type 'a visitAction =
    SkipChildren                        (** Do not visit the children. Return
                                            the node as it is. *)
  | DoChildren                          (** Continue with the children of this
                                            node. Rebuild the node on return
                                            if any of the children changes
                                            (use == test) *)
  | ChangeTo of 'a                      (** Replace the expression with the
                                            given one *)
  | ChangeDoChildrenPost of 'a * ('a -> 'a) (** First consider that the entire
                                           exp is replaced by the first
                                           parameter. Then continue with
                                           the children. On return rebuild
                                           the node if any of the children
                                           has changed and then apply the
                                           function on the node *)


(****************************************************************
 * Visitor engine
 *
 * These functions implement the various actions a visitor can
 * request and provide helper functions for writing visitors.
 *
 * Note that the visitor functions implement a space-saving optimisation:
 * if the result would be identical to the input value, they return the
 * input value to avoid allocating another copy of the object.
 * This optimisation is supported by the mapNoCopy, mapNoCopyList
 * and doVisitList functions.
 *
 * This code is changed from the CIL original by replacing the
 * "cilVisitor" type by "'v" so that the code is independent of
 * the particular AST it is used with.

  match action with
    SkipChildren -> node
  | ChangeTo node' -> node'
  | DoChildren -> children vis node
  | ChangeDoChildrenPost(node', f) -> f (children vis node')

 * change the elements. *)
